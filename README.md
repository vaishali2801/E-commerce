⚙️ How It Works

Products are stored in a JavaScript array as objects

JavaScript dynamically creates product cards

Clicking Add to Cart:

Adds product to cart array

Updates quantity if product already exists

Cart button opens a Bootstrap modal

Total price is calculated dynamically

Checkout clears cart and resets UI
